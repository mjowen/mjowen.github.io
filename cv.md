# Research Experience
My research interests lie in mathematical modelling and machine learning, with a focus on their application to cardiovascular sciences.

My current work focuses on mathematical models of cardiac ion channels. Particularly in their optimisation. I have developed an open-source parameter optimisation benchmarking framework (link) to compare the efficiency of different parameter optimisation approaches (manuscript in preparation). Other projects include work on osmolarity, bifurcation analysis and continuation methods for parameter inference, and modelling hERG1b in cardiac ion channels.

My PhD research consisted of analysis and construction of mathematical models for blood clotting (chemical kinetic ODE models). This included exploratory analysis (sensitivity analysis, timescale analysis, and comparison to patient data; Owen et al. 2024), statistical analysis (functional data analysis) and concluded in the construction of a new model which made use of parameter inference methods (ABC-SMC, gradient descent, and genetic algorithms; manuscript in preparation). This work was funded under an MRC IMPACT DTP Studentship award.

Prior to commencing my MSc (summer of 2018), I was given the opportunity to work on a project to optimise a paediatric cardiovascular surgical procedure called the Fontan procedure. This work consisted of using ANSYS Fluent (Computational Fluid Dynamics software), coupled with original C code, to simulate and compare various plausible blood vessel configurations. I continued this work through my MSc year, culminating in a publication in May 2019 (Corno et al. 2019).
